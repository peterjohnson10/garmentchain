### The Garment Chain DAO Governance Structure

The structure of the DAO governance is approached as a layered system.  
 - Firstly, the place of the DAO itself within the global decentralized, transparent blockchain creates an incentive of deeper connection between already existing sectors and new technologies. 
 - Secondly, the structure is connected to the different types of members on the DAO blockchain system, including producers, distributors, and/or retailers. 
 - And lastly, the system is dependent on the member organizations which will play a vital role with their products´ supply chains being traced.

### DAO Voting and Membership Structure
This will be a hybrid system between the DEVxDAO, of earning voting rights following an MVPR model (see https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/18), and a "usage model."  In the Usage Model, an organization may be approved to be part of the DAO due to use of the NFT minting system of the DAO in order to prevent counterfeits and trace their supply chains.  DAO members must be approved by a majority vote, but those who mint NFT tokens for more than 10,000 garments will be nominated for a vote. If approved, for each garment for which an NFT token is minted, an organization also will gain reputation points within the DAO.   In order to maintain decentralization, no party may have more than 10% of the overall reputation tokens, even if they mint enough NFT tokens to warrant having a larger stake of DAO voting rights.

### DAO: Traceability and decentralization

Due to the rising issue of counterfeiting, countries including the U.S., Italy and France are among the hardest hit, as their economies thrive on producing high-value fashion products, protected by intellectual property rights and trademarks.

To incentivize the players from all the steps in the supply chain in fashion production, is the need to prevent counterfeits by applying NFT token of each item of fashion. Not only does this create a greater sign of quality, but also creates a self-policing mechanism, where the sub-DAO suppliers prevent each other from easily making counterfeit goods without being caught. In addition, the high-end fashion houses an effective way to mitigate supply chain risks by having a more transparent and easy-to-access tracking of their maximal quality throughout every step of the process. Lastly, this way, the brands can quickly retrieve the information about which part of the supply chain is the weak link and where the counterfeiting usually takes place, and hence can turn to other suppliers, if necessary.

### Proposed members: Producers, distributors, and  retailers

The usage of our solution by producers is a first, pivotal step in a successful and optimal tracing of the product and its journey. The idea is to train both the producers of the raw materials (such as cotton, linen, dye, zippers), and companies that produce finished goods (sewing factories, dying factories, design studios) to scan the code of the fashion product. Only by reaching the earliest staged of the production, a full cycle can be reached.

Furthermore, the role of distributors and their entering data about products is a vital part in the supply chain. Because of the globalized outreach of distribution companies, the ability to track the progress of the goods in this stage must be ensured. Indeed, during the transportation and distribution stages, due to the sheer volume of goods moved, there is a great risk for counterfeiting and wrong products being delivered. The focus would be for example on global freight, but also cargo companies including, but not limited to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, Maersk, Deutsche Post, DB Schenker, GLS, or the Royal Mail.

Finally, before the product reaches its end customer, the role of the resellers in the optimal and transparent supply chain using Garment Chain is crucial. While there are many flagship stores of high-end brands whose workers are also trained to detect counterfeit products, when re-selling through retailer stores, there are often multiple brands in one place. To ensure that each of these items has not been counterfeited, the scanning of the code of the product is the easiest, quickest, and most secure way for the clerks and store managers, as well consumers, to verify the origin of an item.  


### Partner organization: Opportunities

According to Forbes, in 2018 counterfeiting was the largest criminal enterprise in the world. That said, Garment Chain is focusing on reaching out to a great network of future partners to combat this issue.

- Firstly, the companies that have already decide to participate on the Garment Chain technology:

        - Abury

        - Scarabeus Sacer

        - AfroFashion

- Secondly, there are contacts through the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Alumnni Network, where team members Peter Johnson and Marie Lendelova both studied.  The high-end fashion brands where the counterfeiting occurs in greatest quantities and that have this alumni network affiliation to the Garment Chain Team:

        - PVH (Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger) – Minzi Keem (JHU 2015), John M Allan Jr (JHU 72 – now retired, but interesting for knowledge), Hongcheng (Leo) Chen (JHU 2018)

        - Ralph Lauren – Rebecca Gordon (JHU nd),

        - Abercrombie & Fitch – Lee Ozbun (JHU 2000 computer science and technology),

        - Rayban (Luxottica) – Inese Buzeneca (ex IFC – NFTs lover !!!)

        - Gucci -彭初阳 (JHU 2017, before LVHM – marketing specialist based in China)

        - LVHM – Louise Firestone (78 JHU), Melody W. (Merchandiser in China, multiple experience from LVHM group, JHU 2018).

        - Chanel - Jennifer Li (JHU affiliation)

        - Versace – Susan Chen (JHU Bachelors)

        - Givenchy - Melody W.(JHU 2018)

        - Armani - Beth McFadden (JHU 2000)

        - Alexander McQueen - Ana Tran Caldarella (JHU 2004)



 

- Thirdly, after the initial Garment Chain is adopted by the above-mentioned brands, other important players in the field are planned to be reach out to:

        - Hermes

        - Dolce & Gabbana –

        - Balenciaga.

        - Prada

        - Burberry

        - Lanvin

        - Alexander McQueen - Ana Tran Caldarella (JHU 2004)

        - Fendi

        - Missoni

        - Tory Burch




These are only a few of the thousands of fashion brands out there, but they are included to give an idea of the great potential that Garment Chain has to grow even more and reach out to new partners.



- Fourthly, other relevant organizations which may join the DAO include the following:

    - Universities and Labs (Duke, Carngegie Mellon University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, etc.)

        - Working on the technology

        - Creating awareness around the problem of counterfeiting

    - Product Certification Bodies (SGS, Intertek, Dekra, etc.)

        - Validating the product

    - Blockchain Ventures and Accelerators (Outlier, gGmbH, Blockchain Valley Ventures, etc.)

        - Supporting the marketing and business development strategy

    - NGOs (Fairtrade, Fashion Revolution, Labour Behind the Label, Clean Clothes Campaign, etc.) 

        - Creating awareness around the problem of counterfeiting

    - Multilateral Organizations (UN, WTO, OECD, World Bank, etc.)

        - Generating data and reports on the problem of counterfeiting

    - Governments (USA, UK, EU, China, etc.)

        - Working on regulations to combat counterfeiting

    - Standard-Setting Organizations (ISO, CEN, ASTM, etc.)

        - Establishing standards for product verification



The above-mentioned organizations are only a few of the many that could be potential partners of Garment Chain. There are endless possibilities for new partnerships and collaborations that can help combat the problem of counterfeiting.
