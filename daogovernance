### The Garment Chain DAO Governance Structure

The structure of the DAO governance is approached as a layered system.  
 - Firstly, the place of the DAO itself within the global decentralized, transparent blockchain creates an incentive of deeper connection between already existing sectors and new technologies. 
 - Secondly, the structure is connected to the different types of members on the DAO blockchain system, including producers, distributors, and/or retailers. 
 - And lastly, the system is dependent on the member organizations which will play a vital role with their products´ supply chains being traced.

### DAO Voting and Membership Structure
This will be a hybrid system between the DEVxDAO, of earning voting rights following an MVPR model (see https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/18), and a "usage model."  In the Usage Model, an organization may be approved to be part of the DAO due to use of the NFT minting system of the DAO in order to prevent counterfeits and trace their supply chains.  DAO members must be approved by a majority vote, but those who mint NFT tokens for more than 10,000 garments will be nominated for a vote. If approved, for each garment for which an NFT token is minted, an organization also will gain reputation points within the DAO.   In order to maintain decentralization, no party may have more than 10% of the overall reputation tokens, even if they mint enough NFT tokens to warrant having a larger stake of DAO voting rights.

The proposals to be voted upon would be developed by the members, and could cover all aspects of regulating the actions taken by the DAO, from funding specific projects to making policy changes in how the DAO operates.

Voting, similar to the DEVxDAO, would first have a phase where at 51% of DAO members must verify they have read through the proposal (based upon voting weight of voters, not absolute number of voters).  There would then be five days for an informal vote, and if approved, voting members of the DAO could stake reputation on the position they plan to take on a vote and a final vote would take place, following the pattern of the DEVxDAO.

### DAO: Traceability and decentralization

Due to the rising issue of counterfeiting, countries including the U.S., Italy and France are among the hardest hit, as their economies thrive on producing high-value fashion products, protected by intellectual property rights and trademarks.

At this first stage, the goal of bringing players in global garment supply chain systems into this is to to prevent counterfeits by applying NFT token of each item of fashion. Not only does this create a greater sign of quality, but also creates a self-policing mechanism, where the sub-DAO suppliers prevent each other from easily making counterfeit goods without being caught. In addition, the high-end fashion houses an effective way to mitigate supply chain risks by having a more transparent and easy-to-access tracking of their maximal quality throughout every step of the process. Lastly, this way, the brands can quickly retrieve the information about which part of the supply chain is the weak link and where the counterfeiting usually takes place, and hence can turn to other suppliers, if necessary.


Incentivizing parties in a supply chain to participate in a DAO can be a challenge, as it requires aligning the interests of different actors with different goals and objectives. However, there are a few strategies that can be used to encourage participation:
-Financial incentives: One way to incentivize participation is to offer financial rewards for completing certain tasks or achieving certain milestones. This could include offering bonuses for meeting production targets, or providing discounts for early adopters.
-Reputation: In a transparent environment like a blockchain, actors can build reputation for meeting or exceed expectations, which can be used as a form of reputation-based incentives.
-Network effects: By joining a DAO, actors in the supply chain can benefit from the network effects of being part of a larger, more connected system. For example, by joining a DAO, a small manufacturer can gain access to new customers and markets, while a distributor can benefit from more efficient logistics and supply chain management.
-Compliance : In some industries, compliance and transparency are a must and by participating in a DAO, actors may be able to demonstrate compliance with industry standards and regulations.
-Long-term benefits: Participating in a DAO can lead to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved transparency in the supply chain, which can provide long-term benefits for all participants.

It's worth noting that, the success of these incentives depend on how well they are communicated, and whether they are perceived as fair and valuable by the actors. It may require a combination of these incentives and others that may apply to specific industries to incentivize adoption and to build a sustainable system.

### Proposed members: Producers, distributors, and  retailers

The usage of our solution by producers is a first, pivotal step in a successful and optimal tracing of the product and its journey. The idea is to train both the producers of the raw materials (such as cotton, linen, dye, zippers), and companies that produce finished goods (sewing factories, dying factories, design studios) to scan the fashion product (NOTE:  An earlier version of this referred to scanning the code of the product, but as we now plan to use "Physical-Based Tokens" there is no code to scan, the actual item itself will be scanned, as explained in Milestone 2). Only by reaching the earliest staged of the production, a full cycle can be reached.

Furthermore, the role of distributors and their entering data about products is a vital part in the supply chain. Because of the globalized outreach of distribution companies, the ability to track the progress of the goods in this stage must be ensured. Indeed, during the transportation and distribution stages, due to the sheer volume of goods moved, there is a great risk for counterfeiting and wrong products being delivered. The focus would be for example on global freight, but also cargo companies including, but not limited to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, Maersk, Deutsche Post, DB Schenker, GLS, or the Royal Mail.

Before the product reaches its end customer, the role of the resellers in the optimal and transparent supply chain using Garment Chain is crucial. While there are many flagship stores of high-end brands whose workers are also trained to detect counterfeit products, when re-selling through retailer stores, there are often multiple brands in one place. To ensure that each of these items has not been counterfeited, the scanning of the code of the product is the easiest, quickest, and most secure way for the clerks and store managers, as well consumers, to verify the origin of an item.  

Independent auditors play a key role as well in this system, and similar to DEVxDAO´s code review DAO, a system could be established to reward and compensate auditors for participating in the system.

At launch, supply chain traceability auditors are most important. These organizations can assess the accuracy and completeness of a supply chain's transparency efforts and ensure that materials and products can be traced back to their origin.  As this system develops further, moving beyond the initial use of preventing counterfeits, the DAO could also add the following kinds of auditors:
1. Social compliance auditors: These organizations are experts in labor standards and worker rights, and can assess whether factories and manufacturers are complying with laws and regulations related to issues such as working hours, wages, and health and safety.
2. Environmental auditors: These organizations can assess whether suppliers and manufacturers are following sustainable practices and complying with regulations related to issues such as energy usage, pollution and waste management.
3. Product safety auditors: These organizations can verify that products meet safety regulations and are free of harmful substances, also known as testing laboratories.

It would be beneficial to have multiple third-party auditors involved with the DAO, to provide multiple perspectives and ensure a thorough evaluation. It's also worth noting that it is important for the auditors to be reputable, independent, and to have the appropriate certifications and qualifications to perform the necessary audits.
