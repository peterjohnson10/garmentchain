### The Garment Chain DAO Governance Structure

- The structure of the DAO governance is approached as a layered system. 
    - Firstly, the place of the DAO itself within the global decentralized, transparent blockchain creates an incentive of deeper connection between already existing sectors and new technologies.
    - Secondly, the structure is connected to the different types of members on the DAO blockchain system, including producers, distributors, and/or retailers. 
    - And lastly, the system is dependent on the member organizations which will play a vital role with their products´ supply chains being traced.


- DAO Voting and Membership Structure
This will be a hybrid system between the DEVxDAO, of earning voting rights following an MVPR model (see https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/18), and a "usage model."  

- In the "Usage Model," an organization may be approved to be part of the DAO for exceeding a "minimum usage level" of the NFT minting system of the DAO in order to prevent counterfeits and track their supply chains.  Reaching a mimimum usage level could be considered in the same way as having a milestone reached and verified in the DEVxDAO.  Once this level is met, the organization could be voted upon to become a voting member.  Similar to the DEVxDAO, there would also be the option to propose a specific task or project that benefits the Garment Chain DAO community, which upon completion could earn an individual or organization the right to be considered for DAO membership.

- A minimum usage level would be decided by the DAO, and would be based on the value of the goods tracked by the NFT minting system.  To ensure that smaller parties in the supply chain are not excluded, an early decision of the DAO will be if different sized DAO members would have a different minimum usage level based on the size of their organization.  In such a scenario, a small farmer producing cotton, an artisanal weaver, or a small boutique fashion designer may face a different minimum usage level than a large global organization like Gucci or Nike.  The exact structure of this can be set and voted upon by the initial DAO members and can be voted upon again and revised if needed. 

- Measuring by total number garments tracked was also considered as a way to measure usage, instead of total value of items tracked, but this may incentivize fast fashion, rather than improved quality of goods.  This is significant, as a later iteration of this tool will seek to foster the circular economy and reduce fashion waste.

- If DAO membership is approved, an organization will gain reputation points within the DAO based on the value of its use of the NFT minting system, or by its contributions to the Garment Chain DAO community.   In order to maintain decentralization, we will seek a model, possibly through a logarithmic voting system, to prevent any one party from being a controlling party over the rest of the DAO.


- Once we begin building this DAO, DAO-builder Menagerie is being considered, which is being developed by DEVxDAO Voting Associate and co-founder Wulf Kaal.


### DAO: Traceability and decentralization

Due to the rising issue of counterfeiting, countries including the U.S., Italy and France are among the hardest hit, as their economies thrive on producing high-value fashion products, protected by intellectual property rights and trademarks.

To incentivize the players from all the steps in the supply chain in fashion production, is the need to prevent counterfeits by applying NFT token of each item of fashion. Not only does this create a greater sign of quality, but also creates a self-policing mechanism, where the sub-DAO suppliers prevent each other from easily making counterfeit goods without being caught. In addition, the high-end fashion houses an effective way to mitigate supply chain risks by having a more transparent and easy-to-access tracking of their maximal quality throughout every step of the process. Lastly, this way, the brands can quickly retrieve the information about which part of the supply chain is the weak link and where the counterfeiting usually takes place, and hence can turn to other suppliers, if necessary.

### Proposed members: Producers, distributors, and  retailers

The usage of our solution by producers is a first, pivotal step in a successful and optimal tracing of the product and its journey. The idea is to train both the producers of the raw materials (such as cotton, linen, dye, zippers), and companies that produce finished goods (sewing factories, dying factories, design studios) to scan the code of the fashion product. Only by reaching the earliest staged of the production, a full cycle can be reached.

Furthermore, the role of distributors and their entering data about products is a vital part in the supply chain. Because of the globalized outreach of distribution companies, the ability to track the progress of the goods in this stage must be ensured. Indeed, during the transportation and distribution stages, due to the sheer volume of goods moved, there is a great risk for counterfeiting and wrong products being delivered. The focus would be for example on global freight, but also cargo companies including, but not limited to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, Maersk, Deutsche Post, DB Schenker, GLS, or the Royal Mail.

Finally, before the product reaches its end customer, the role of the resellers in the optimal and transparent supply chain using Garment Chain is crucial. While there are many flagship stores of high-end brands whose workers are also trained to detect counterfeit products, when re-selling through retailer stores, there are often multiple brands in one place. To ensure that each of these items has not been counterfeited, the scanning of the code of the product is the easiest, quickest, and most secure way for the clerks and store managers, as well consumers, to verify the origin of an item.  


### Partner organization: Opportunities

According to Forbes, in 2018 counterfeiting was the largest criminal enterprise in the world. That said, Garment Chain is focusing on reaching out to a great network of future partners to combat this issue.

- Firstly, the companies that have already decide to participate on the Garment Chain technology:

        - Abury

        - Scarabeus Sacer

        - AfroFashion

- Secondly, there are contacts through the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Alumnni Network, where team members Peter Johnson and Marie Lendelova both studied.  The high-end fashion brands where the counterfeiting occurs in greatest quantities and that have this alumni network affiliation to the Garment Chain Team:

        - PVH (Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger) – Minzi Keem (JHU 2015), John M Allan Jr (JHU 72 – now retired, but interesting for knowledge), Hongcheng (Leo) Chen (JHU 2018)
