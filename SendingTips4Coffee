# Coffee Supply Chain

This code implements a Rust-based coffee supply chain system. The system allows for creating a digital ID and wallet for each worker in the supply chain and for consumers to be able to send a tip to the wallet of any workers who has been part of the production of a garment they now own.

## Functions

The following functions are implemented in the code:

* `createDigitalID()`: Creates a digital ID for a worker.
* `tipWorker()`: Sends a tip to the wallet of a worker.

## Usage

To use the code, you will need to:

1. Install the `web3` package.
2. Create a Web3 instance.
3. Create a contract instance for the CoffeeSupplyChain contract.
4. Call the desired functions on the contract instance.

For example, to create a digital ID for a worker, you would call the `createDigitalID()` function:

```rust
let digital_id = CoffeeSupplyChain::create_digital_id(&contract, wallet_address);
